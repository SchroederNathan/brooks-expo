/**
 * Icons for the app-owned bottom tab bar.
 *
 * @ref LLP 0003#icons-and-the-logo — Three of the five tabs are real sprite
 * glyphs lifted verbatim from brooksrunning.com: `#icon-search` (Browse),
 * `#icon-cart` (Cart), `#icon-account` (Profile). The sprite has no home, no
 * shoe, and no storefront glyph — a website needs none of them — so Home and
 * Shoe Finder are drawn here to sit at the real set's line weight.
 *
 * Browse wears the magnifier because Browse *is* the search screen: its own
 * field is the search (LLP 0003#browse-is-the-search-screen). It used to wear a
 * drawn 2×2 grid, with the magnifier on Shoe Finder; the shoe says what that
 * tab is about directly.
 *
 * The focus rule still constrains the drawn glyphs: any glyph whose top edge is
 * a long horizontal merges with the dash on the bar's top edge (that is what
 * disqualified `#icon-filters`). The shoe's top edge is a short heel collar
 * and a slope, and its long horizontals are at the bottom, away from the dash.
 *
 * Weight normalization: the sprite encodes non-uniform line weights (the cart's
 * line-work is ~1.3 viewBox units, the account's ~1.4, the search ring's ~1.9),
 * so equal render sizes read as unequal strokes. A fill cannot be thinned, only
 * fattened, so each glyph is thickened up to a shared ~2.2px and the two drawn
 * glyphs stroke at 2.2 directly. *
 * The Liquid Glass bar shows these same glyphs as PNGs, which
 * `tools/tab-icons/render.js` draws from a copy of the geometry here. After
 * changing a glyph, a size, or `thicken`, update that copy and rerun it.

/**
 * Sprite-backed tabs. `size` is per glyph, not shared: `BrooksIcon` scales to
 * fit a `size` box on the glyph's *longer* axis, so a single value would render
 * the wide-and-short funnel wider than the tall-and-narrow account figure. These
 * values equalize drawn width instead — except the account figure, which is
 * taller than wide, so it is matched on height the way a person glyph should be.
 * `thicken` then brings each glyph's encoded weight up to the shared ~2.2px; the
 * funnel reaches it unaided (1.75 viewBox units × 21/16.89 ≈ 2.18).
